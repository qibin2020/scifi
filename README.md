# SciFi — Autonomous Agent System for SCIentific Workloads with an LLM-Native Interface

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2604.13180-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.13180)

`SciFi: Process the dataset, run this paper method, generate the plots, and make sure you reproduce all the paper results exactly. Suggest what we can optimize and submit SLURM jobs to test—I’ll decide what to try next.`

`SciFi: Read the board manual, understand the interface, find the data on disk, write the RTL to implement the algorithm, and make sure all tests 100% pass. I’ll need it ready for the experiment tomorrow.`

## Talk to It

```bash
SciFi "run the hello test"
SciFi "create a task that trains MNIST on GPU"
SciFi "what tasks have I run?"
SciFi -- "run task_xxx"         # skip confirmation
SciFi help                      # actually you don't need "" if shell is happy
```

`SciFi` is the natural language interface — just say what you want. For direct commands: `SciF RUN`, `SciF MAKE`, `SciF ASK`, `SciF STATUS`.

## Setup

```bash
cp .secret.sh.template .secret.sh
vi .secret.sh                   # set your API keys
chmod 600 .secret.sh            # required — ENV.sh enforces this
source ENV.sh
SciF BOOTSTRAP                  # first time only
SciFi "start and run test_hello"
```

Optional: share SSH keys with agents for private repo access:
```bash
cp -r ~/.ssh F/home/
```

## Task Format

Create `Sam/tasks/<name>/top.md`:

```markdown
---
Rank: 1
---

# My Task

## Context
What the agent needs to know.

## Todo
1. Step one
2. Step two

## Expect
- output.txt exists with "hello"
- tests pass
```

All behavior is controlled through metadata in `top.md` — you never edit driver scripts.

| Field | Default | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `Rank: N` | auto | Difficulty. 0 = trivial, 1 = typical, 2 = reasoning, 3+ = hard |
| `ForceModel: name` | rank-based | Pin worker model (e.g. `llama4-scout`) |
| `ControlModel: name` | highest | Pin review model (e.g. `qwen3-coder`) |
| `Thinking: N` | off | Force thinking mode with N token budget |
| `BashTime: N` | 600 | Max seconds per bash call. `-1` = unlimited |
| `Skills: a, b` | auto | Skills to inject |
| `NoMemory: on\|off` | `off` | Clean-room run: don't read global memory, don't write global history |
| `CommonHome: rw\|ro\|disable` | `rw` | Shared home mount (`F/home/` → `/home`) |
| `CommonStorage: rw\|ro\|disable` | `rw` | Shared storage mount (`F/mnt/` → `/mnt`) |
| `GPU: no\|local\|slurm\|on` | `no` | GPU policy |
| `Slurm: off\|on` | `off` | SLURM submission access |

## Agent Environment

Agents run in isolated containers. What they see:

| Path | Persistent | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `./` (task dir) | Yes | All outputs and per-task environments go here |
| `/mnt/` | Yes | Shared assets and reusable environments across tasks |
| `/home/` | Read-only* | SSH keys, git config |
| Everything else | No | RAM overlay, discarded on exit |

\* With `CommonHome: rw`, writes to `/home` persist. Default `ro` discards writes.

**Python environments**: the container ships with `micromamba` + `pip`. Agents create environments under `./` (per-task, throwaway) or `/mnt/` (shared, reusable across tasks). The base environment is read-only and reserved for the driver — installs into it are silently discarded on exit.

```bash
# Per-task env (under ./)
MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX=./mamba_env micromamba create -n work python=3.12 -y
micromamba run -r ./mamba_env -n work pip install <package>

# Shared env (under /mnt, reusable across tasks)
MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX=/mnt/envs micromamba create -n shared python=3.12 -y
```

## Learn More

Chat with `SciFi` to explore the system, or read:
- `F/F.design.md` — Architecture, concurrency, recovery paths
- `F/F.usage.md` — Commands, skills, evolution
- `Pam/gateway.rank.yaml` — Model rankings and budgets

## Important Notice: LLM API, Ranks, and Budget

By default, multiple models are configured at different ranks, suitable for daily use and load-balanced across providers. The system assumes you have AWS Bedrock, Anthropic, and Ollama Cloud API keys (Anthropic direct is disabled by default; Bedrock is the primary backend).

To reproduce the paper results, set up at least Ollama Cloud API and keep only Gemma4 by setting all other models' budgets to 0 in `Pam/gateway.rank.yaml`.

**Budget is per run, not cumulative** — it caps the number of API calls per task run, not across runs. This workflow is token-heavy due to iterative agent loops, so monitor your usage. Consider starting with subscription-based APIs (not pay-per-use) and cost-effective models. Refer to [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/) for detailed budget control.
